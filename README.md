# Taylor-Forecast-Computer
A Javascript implementation of the Taylor Weather Forecast Computer.
Users input the trending wind direction and 12 hour barometric pressure trend, generating a forecast for the next 12-24 hours.

Sparse information is available on the device's history. The Taylor Forecast Computer appears to be a mid 20th century derivative of the Wind-Barometer Table(1), created by Meteorologist EB Garriot in the late 19th century. The Forecasts generated should be generally accurate for the northern hemisphere, with highest accuracy in North America and the Continental US.

(1) multiple versions of this table exist. See "Monthly Weather Review", US Weather Bureau, May 1897; "The yearbook of the Dept. of Agriculture", 1909;  US coast Guard Recreational Boating Guide, Page 49, 1963. They are still popular among mariners and outdoorsmen as a basic weather guide, when limited information is available.
