# Taylor-Forecast-Computer
A Javascript implementation of the Taylor Forecast Computer. Users input the trending wind direction and 12 hour barometric pressure trend, and a local forecast for the next 12-24 hours is generated.

The Taylor Forecast Computer appears to be a mid-century derivative of the Wind-Barometer Table, created by a Professor EB Garriot in the late 19th century- See "Monthly Weather Review", US Weather Bureau, May 1897; US coast Guard Recreational Boating Guide, Page 49, 1963; "The yearbook of the Dept. of Agriculture", 1909. The Wind-Barometer Tables are used to this day, giving general weather trends for the Contentintal United States.
